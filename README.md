> [!WARNING]
> The `Video` and `Audio` APIs from `expo-av` have been deprecated and replaced by improved and more powerful APIs in [`expo-video`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/video/) and [`expo-audio`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/audio/). It is strongly recommended to use those libraries instead. `expo-av` is not receiving patches and was removed in SDK 55.
>
> This repository contains an archived source code of the last release in SDK 54. [See the documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v54.0.0/sdk/av/).
